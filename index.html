<div id="one"><img src="images/icon3.png" alt=""><caption>Thousands of wheelchair users
affected by the lack of accessible stations</caption></div>
  <p>When Alexis Batista was a student at the Globe Institute of Technology, in Lower
    Manhattan, he lived a few feet away from the 174-175 St. subway station in the Bronx.
    Instead, he would travel for 30 minutes by bus to the nearest station with an
    elevator. As a <mark>wheelchair user</mark>, Batista, 37, is one of the thousands of New
    Yorkers impacted by the lack of accessible stations.</p>


	<p>Sometimes, he found a broken elevator. “I would break into tears,” he explained.
    Batista would then retake the bus he took early, transfer to another bus that
    dropped him off at 135th St. station, which is wheelchair accessible. His trip
    could take up to 2 hours but if 174-175 St. were accessible it would take 45 minutes.
  <p>On occasions, he’d call Fire or Police Department to carry him down to the platform.
    “The shame I’d feel being carried down the stairs,” said Batista, who now resides in
    the Upper West Side.</p>
    <div id="two"><img src="images/icon2.png" alt=""><caption>24 percent of the 472 stations in New York City are wheelchair
    accessible</caption></div></p>
  <p>Batista’s experience is shared by numerous wheelchairs users who rely on public
transportation. Currently, only <mark>24%</mark> of the 472 stations in New York City are wheelchair
accessible. This translates into loss of independence, frustration with navigating the
subway system, and additional traveling time, which impact their work situation.</p>

<p>According to a 2018 report ‘Service Denied: Accessibility and the New York City Subway
  System’ by NYC Comptroller: “Those living in areas without accessible stations will
  struggle to reach the 2.7 million jobs in areas that are accessible by subway, while
  the 608,258 jobs in neighborhoods without subway accessibility are even more challenging
  to access.”
  <div id="four"><img src="images/icon1.png" alt=""><caption>68% of stations in the Bronw are inaccessible</caption></div>
<p>When Batista was a Bronx resident, he traveled to an accessible station in a borough where
  68% of stations were <mark>inaccessible</mark>. As an Upper West Side resident, that number lowers to  26%.</p>


<p>“It’s unfair,” said Arquelia Vega, 47, after leaving the 96 St. station in the Upper West Side.
  “This is a rich country, put some elevators. I don’t understand why there are elevators only in
  certain places,” she added.</p>
  <div id="three"><img src="images/icon4.png" alt=""><caption>this is just info</caption></div>
  <p>The report establishes that “these barriers to the labor market exacerbate the high rates of
    unemployment and low rates of workforce participation among the disabled.” According to the Census,
    the employment rate for the mobility-impaired aged 25 to 65 is 23%, for the <mark>non-disabled</mark> population is 74% </p>

<p> In 2016, Disabilities Rights Advocates, a nationwide non-profit, sued the Metropolitan Transportation
  Authority, or MTA, for violating the American Disability Act, which states that after extensive renovations
  to a station, an elevator needs to be installed, as happened in Middletown Road station that year.

<p>The MTA have defended its decision arguing that sometimes installing an elevator is no economically feasible.
 Dustin Jones, a Board Member of the Center for the Independence of the Disabled in New York City, doesn’t believe
 economic the argument. “There is money for WIFI and retrofitting buses, but no money for a civil rights issue,” he said.</p>

<p>Judge Geoffrey S. Berman, from the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of DRA The decision is not binding,
but it’s a first step towards the day wheelchairs could access any of the 472 subway stations.
The MTA Press office was reached but declined to comment for this story.</p>
